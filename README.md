FIGHT PCOS BY LOVING YOURSELF

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a medical condition which causes hormonal disorder in women in their childbearing years.

Women with PCOS majorly suffer from excessive weight gain, facial hair growth, acne, hair loss, skin darkening and irregular periods leading to infertility in rare cases.

Machine learning can play a significant role in automating PCOS detection based on medical data and patient information.
